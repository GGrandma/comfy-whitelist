ComfyWhitelist is a flexible and user-friendly whitelist plugin for Minecraft Paper servers,

- :globe_with_meridians: **Broad Version Support**: ComfyWhitelist is designed to support a wide range of Minecraft versions
  (from 1.13 to 1.20), ensuring usability across different server setups.
- :speaking_head: **Multilingual Support**: ComfyWhitelist boasts multi-language support. 
  It caters to a broad array of languages including English (**en**), Russian (**ru**), Ukrainian (**uk**),

## :computer: For Developers

ComfyWhitelist provides a developer-friendly API that can be used to leverage
the plugin's functionalities in your own plugins. You can find more details and
usage examples in our [ComfyWhitelistApi](https://github.com/cocahonka/comfy-whitelist-api).

## :inbox_tray: Installation

To install the plugin, navigate to the 'Releases' section of our GitHub
repository. Here you will find two versions of the plugin for each release:
**standalone** and **lightweight**.

- The '**standalone**' version works right out of the box, you just need to put it in the plugin's folder.
- The '**lightweight**' version requires a separate [Kotlin dependency](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/kotlin-stdlib.80808/)
to be downloaded and placed in the plugin folder.

The versioning follows this format: MAJOR.MINOR.FIX

The latest release is capable of running on versions `1.13.* - 1.20.*`

By default, the type of login verification is set to nickname!

## :gear: Configuration

The plugin offers extensive customization options through its configuration
files. You can modify messages, change their colors using tags provided by
the plugin, or any colors from [this site](https://docs.advntr.dev/minimessage/format.html).
The plugin-specific color tags are:
- `<warning>`
- `<success>`
- `<remove>`
- `<off>`

Also, you have the options to select the language, specify the type of login verification (either by nickname or UUID),
among other settings.
